## Intro
DeltaImg is a responsive image system that you can read about [here](http://hacks.philingrey.com/2012/03/deltaimg-resolution-and-bandwidth-responsive-images/), it has two parts:
 - A node.js script (create.js) to make the low-resolution and difference files
 - A client side script (~500B) to stitch the images together

## Use
The node.js script requires [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas) `npm install canvas`
